          <Clause n="1" title="Using the service">
            By using {APP_NAME}, you agree to these terms. The app is provided as-is. You are
            responsible for understanding the risks of leveraged trading on testnet.
          </Clause>

          <Clause n="2" title="Eligibility">
            You confirm you are of legal age in your jurisdiction and that interacting with
            HashKey Chain-based derivatives is not prohibited by applicable law. Residents of restricted
            jurisdictions must not use this interface.
          </Clause>

          <Clause n="3" title="No financial advice">
            Nothing on {APP_NAME} constitutes financial, legal, or tax advice. Oracle prices and
            premiums are computed mechanically from on-chain state and may be inaccurate due to
            oracle latency.
          </Clause>

          <Clause n="4" title="Protocol risks">
            Smart contract risk, oracle deviation, flash-loan reversion, and exchange settlement
            risk all apply. The {APP_NAME} interface does not custody funds — all positions settle
            directly through Molfi smart contracts on HashKey Chain.
          </Clause>

          <Clause n="5" title="Limitation of liability">
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, the contributors to {APP_NAME} shall not be
            liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising
            from your use of the protocol.
          </Clause>

          <Clause n="6" title="Changes to terms">
            These terms may change as the protocol evolves. Continued use after a change constitutes
            acceptance of the revised terms.
          </Clause>
